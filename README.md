# **Problem**

ZaloPay launched a referral campaign to acquire new users and drive transactions. However, the system was exploited by bot users who automated account creation, referrals, and redemptions â€” draining >3B VND in promotion costs and distorting KPIs. The objective of this project was to detect abuse patterns, quantify impact, and propose scalable prevention strategies.

# **Business Questions**

- How many users participated in the campaign?
- What is the total transaction and discount volume?
- What behavioral patterns indicate abuse?
- How many abusive users were involved?
- How much discount value was exploited?
- What rules can mitigate abuse without harming real users?

# Process

1. Understanding the business context
2. Defining abuse hypotheses
3. Data analysis & pattern detection
4. Designing risk prevention rules
5. Measuring the impact & recommendations
